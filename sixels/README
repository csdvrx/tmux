You can test the sixel feature with the usual sixel test images, for example
 zcat vimperator3.six.gz

To generate sixels of a specific size for test, use gnuplot compiled with :
  --with-gd --with-bitmap-terminals

You can then set the window size as part of GNUTERM parameters
 export GNUTERM="sixelgd size 1280,720 truecolor font arial 16"
 echo plot sin(x) |gnuplot

You can also run it as a oneliner
 echo plot sin(x) | GNUTERM="sixelgd size 300,200 truecolor" gnuplot

For quick tests, the attached gnuplot.sh script takes 2 parameters: x and y
